# Alchitry Cu Codes

This repository will contain the pre-requisite ideas and test files that I need to work,practice and learn for my FPGA works. Final idea is about creating a IP block that I will synthesis on my FPGAs (As of now Alchitry, later on Shrike-lite by Vicharak) before entering into Openlane for the Digital ASIC designs.


## Progress

Keeping it vague as of now, I tried testing the use of 'makefile' and must say it is interesting also.As of now it is at small project level. Finally will move it to  complete Repository level.
